#iOS Apple-pie-Game
Introduction:
In this game, you must find the letters to fill in the vacant places that represent words or phrases.
Your forecasts are limited, and each incorrect prediction brings you one step closer to losing the
game. The goal is to solve the puzzle before your guesses run out.

The logic of the app would include The game selecting a word or phrase at random from a prepared
list. Each letter of the word or phrase is shown on the screen as a blank area. The player has a
limited number of tries to guess the letters of the word or phrase. If the player correctly guesses
the letter, all occurrences of that letter are filled in on the board. If a player gets a letter wrong,
they lose one of their remaining guesses. If the player correctly predicts every letter of the word
or phrase before their guesses run out, they win the game. If a player runs out of guesses before
guessing every letter, the game is over.

Project Description and Requirements:
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Xcode, Apple's official IDE for iOS app
development, is required to create an iOS Apple Pie App. Swift programming knowledge, which
is the primary language for iOS development. The app should include a predefined list of phrases
or words from which to select at random. The software should display empty spaces between
each letter of the word or sentence. The software should allow users to forecast letters to fill in
the blanks. The app should maintain track of how many more guesses are available and display a
hangman image to highlight how many incorrect guesses were made. If the estimate was right or
wrong, the app ought to provide a sound effect and/or an animation to let the user know. When
the game is done, the app ought to have a win/lose status and provide the player with a message.
There should be a "play again" button on the app to begin a fresh game.

Designs:
Maintain an easy-to-use user interface. Use legible typography and a tidy layout. Use eye-catching
colors and visuals that go with the topic of the app. To improve the user experience, you
may think about using pictures of apple pies or autumnal hues. Add animations to the game to
make it more interactive and interesting. To guarantee a smooth user experience across all
devices, make sure the app is suited for all screen sizes and orientations.

Goals:
Provide entertainment: The app's main objective may be to give users a pleasant and interesting
game to play while killing time. Engagement: If the app is being developed for a company or
organization, the objective can be to boost user interaction and draw in more patrons. Build
skills: The app may be made to assist users in expanding their word knowledge, spelling, and
word recognition abilities.

Tools:
For this project, we need to have a MacBook or an Apple device that allows us to code. The
programming language being used for this project is Swift, Swift is a programming language
developed by Apple for the development of iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and other Apple
operating systems. It was introduced in 2014 as a modern, fast, safe, and efficient programming
language to replace Objective-C as the primary language for iOS app development. The IDE
being used to develop this app is Xcode version 14. Xcode was also developed by Apple for
developing software for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. It provides developers with a set of
tools and features to create, debug, and test applications.

Technical Specifications:
Several classes are required to build this application so far, we have a main
storyboard which is filled with several stack views and buttons all integrated.

Conclusion:
The iOS Apple Pie word guessing game app may be an entertaining and interesting method to
test users' word knowledge and word recognition abilities. Clear goals, a user-friendly interface,
and technical requirements such as programming language, user interface, game logic, storage, and
testing should all be considered when creating a successful app. Developers may design an app
that is both enjoyable and informative, and that satisfies the requirements and expectations of
their target market by utilizing the appropriate tools and technology.
